# Client APIs

Kafka has first-class JVM (Java) support, but communicates over TCP and has good client support/bindings for other languages.

From a JVM point-of-view, the main client APIs are:
* Kafka Connect
* Kafka Consumer/Producer API
* Kafka Streams

## Kafka Connect

## Kafka Consumer/Producer API
